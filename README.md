# Social Media Platform with tRPC, Tanstack-Query, Next-Auth, Framer-motion, etc.

Made with the T3 Stack.

Similar to a platform like twitter:
Users can create posts. Other users can like that post or leave a comment on it.
You can view posts you've created and liked in your profile page.

Made this thing in 2 days btw
TODO:

- handle loading states
